      <p><b>Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger.The original Grey Hulk was shown as average intelligent being  who roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at "puny" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech. radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form and while he became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group, believing he would never be trusted. </b></p>
      
		<h3><b>hulks abilities and info about them</b></h3>
		<p><b>super human strength:He is the stongest marvel super hero ever hes strength is limitless its based on hes rage hes base strength is he can lift over 100 tons.  
			</b></p>
		<p><b>Self Sustenance:the hulk can adapt to any enviorment very quickly for example like space if he is in space he can adapt so he does not need air to breathe and if he is in space long enough he will not need food or water</b></p>
      <p><b>Prolonged Longevity:The Hulk ages at an incredibly slow rate. Because of his great healing factor that regenerates his cells, and the gamma energy and the dark magic he has absorbed that empowers him, the Hulk has an extremely long lifespan. A possible alternate persona, the Maestro, was still in his physical prime despite being more than one hundred years old . In another alternate future the Hulk outlived mankind on earth and was still in his physical prime .</b></p>
		<p><b>Superhuman Speed:Regardless of his size, Hulk's superhumanly strong legs allow him to run at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete (about 770 mph). Nevertheless, this does not grant him any enhanced reflexes or agility as smaller foes exploit his size and use it to their advantage. However, he has been fast enough to catch mortar shells shot at him.</b></p>
		<p><b>Superhuman Durability:The Hulk's skin is impervious to conventional blades, adamantium and vibranium being amongst the very few metals that are truly capable of piercing his skin. The Hulk is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, powerful explosives, pressures extremes, falls from orbital heights. The Hulk was also able to withstand the force equivalent to thousands of nuclear weapons , planet-devastating impacts at point blank, and a powerful blast from Galactus. The Hulk's durability, like his strength, is fueled by rushes of adrenaline while angry.</b></p>
